Project Description: Microsoft Excel Analysis of Lyonshare Global Energy Limited Expenses

This project aims to develop a comprehensive Microsoft Excel-based analytical tool to evaluate the financial expenses of Lyonshare Global Energy Limited across three business units (Advertising, Hardware, and Software) over a 12-year period. The tools I used were to analyze historical data, compare scenarios (Actuals, Budgets, Forecast), and provide actionable insights through pivot tables, charts, and an interactive dashboard. 
By consolidating and visualizing the data in an interactive, user-friendly dashboard, stakeholders can easily access key insights and make informed decisions to enhance operational efficiency and financial discipline.
